    <h2>A little about me:</h2>
  
    <p>Since I was a kid, computers has always held a special place in my heart. I remember the day my mother finally gave me permission to use her expensive top of the line IBM laptop to do a school project. I felt like there was nothing that this 256mb of RAM beast couldn’t do and that the world was at my fingers, I mean I could access the internet and see everything that the world has to show me, I could play video games, I could use it to send emails contacting whoever I want anywhere in the world, I could even use it to CREATE NEW SOFTWARE - the possibilities were endless. What I ultimately did was draw pictures and make "my dream house' floor plans" in paint. How very exciting. </p>
    <p>Its been a long road since then and have branched out into many different passions. Honing my craft in 3D design, interior rendering, software development, web design and oh before I forget, I still am quite an avid user of MS paint. It’s frightening how much I still have to learn but also incredibly exciting. I’ve met so many different people in this industry and all I can say is, that I’m right at home. </p>
